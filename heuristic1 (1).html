      <h1>1. Visibility of System Status</h1>
      <h2>Short Summary</h2>
      <p>The first usability heuristic, Visibility of System Status, means that a system should always keep users informed about what is going on through clear and timely feedback. This helps users understand whether their actions have been successful or if the system is still processing something. For example, when a website shows a loading bar or a confirmation message after submitting a form, it reassures the user that their input was received and that the system is responding. Without this visibility, users may become confused, frustrated, or think something has gone wrong. Overall, this heuristic focuses on building trust and confidence by maintaining clear communication between the system and the user..</p>
